This Calculator project is part of the Odin Project curriculum

The project primarily displays HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills

The end result will be a HTML calculator styled with CSS and powered by Javascript code

The calculator purposefully only evaluates two numbers at at time.

I will admit, I had to throw out my code and start from scratch at one point. This was not easy.
